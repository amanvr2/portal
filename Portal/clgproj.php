            It is an honour to be the principal of Guru Nanak Dev Institute of Technology formerly known as Guru Nanak dev Co-Ed Polytechnic, One of the premier institute imparting technical education under the aegis of Directorate of Training and Technical Education, Govt. of NCT of Delhi, and with deep sense of honour, pride and gratification, I welcome you all and introduce you to the sphere of Guru Nanak Dev Institute of technology formerly known as Guru Nanak Dev Co-Ed Polytechnic. The institute began its journey way back in 1995 in a borrowed space in Pusa Polytechnic and shifted to its own building in 1997, since then we have been able to achieve many milestones, from three branches (30 intake in each branch) to now six branches of two shifts of more than 700 intake each year, from being a small relatively unknown polytechnic to one of the most well-known and sought after polytechnic. In the endeavor to achieve success, we have over the years built up the state of the art infrastructure and equipment, made more efficient by the most dedicated and experienced members of the faculty. Apart from providing best physical infrastructure and faculty our endeavor is also to create such environment for the students to communicate and learn from their peers and alumni and also through summer internships with the companies and get hands on experience. Itâ€™s not out of place to put on record that our students have been placed with most leading companies in various field and since have been able to reach enviable positions by their dedication and hard work. Our students have been proving to be assets of the companies where they work. I look forward to their bright future at the same time our vision is to produce conscientious, smart and confident diploma engineers and citizens of India who will go out into the world and make us proud.
